# Admin Component Preview (Flynt Feature)

Add layout screenshots of a component to its component folder to show a preview in the front end and WordPress back end.

Components can then be previewed in multiple scenarios:

## Front end

When logged in, click the 'Component Preview' button on the WordPress admin bar to overlay a preview image (with reduced opacity). For easy pixel perfect development, drag the images around or move them with the arrow keys.

## Back end

The preview image will be shown beside the component name in the flexible content group layout.

Rollover a component name inside the "Add Component" dropdown menu to see the desktop and mobile preview images.

## Usage

Prepare a file size optimized `preview-desktop.jpg` and `preview-mobile.jpg` to put inside your component folder.

- `preview-desktop.jpg` should be 1440x900 px.
- `preview-mobile.jpg` should be 320x480 px.
