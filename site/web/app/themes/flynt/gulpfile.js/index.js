  gulpfile.js
  ===========
  Rather than manage one giant configuration file responsible
  for creating multiple tasks, each task has been broken out into
  its own file in gulp/tasks. Any files in that directory get
  automatically required below.

  To add a new task, simply add a new task file that directory.
  gulp/tasks/default.js specifies the default set of tasks to run
  when you run `gulp`.
